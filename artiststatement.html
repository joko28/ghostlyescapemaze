          <i>This project was based on the idea of puzzles because when I was kid, I thought puzzles were fun since it helped develop critical thinking. I got my inspiration from the Pac-Man arcade video game, a Japanese video game created by Toru
            Iwatani. The idea of how a maze is like a person’s life and our demons keep coming after us so we need to find a way to get out.</i>
          <br><br>
          <i>In the game, players will come to a dark purple screen titled the name of the game “Ghostly Escape Maze.” The "Enter" key will first lead to the information screen with directions on how to play, plus introduces the game. Press "Enter"
            key again, then it will officially start the game, starting from level 1 to 3. The name of the game is on top of the screen, there will be a timer, and you can save your game screen.</i>
            <br><br>
          <i> The setting will be simple and cute, but also evil because this game is supposed to be about escaping the demons. The game will end when the player wins the game, or if the ghost catches the player. When the player is caught, they will
            only be able to play again by pressing "Enter." The player can only win if they can get out of the maze within a set time span.</i>
            <br><br>
          <i>The end game screen will either show a green screen saying "You Win" or a red screen with saying “Game Over.” At the end of each level will be another, there are only three levels in total. Then if you want to fully restart, then you can
            press the Restart Game below the screen. You can also view the artist statement.</i>
            <br><br>
          <i>The program software it is using is p5.Javascript, HTML, and CSS all done on Atom.io and GitHub.</i>
